#Interactive resume

##Abstract:
This project was an exercise to explore the functionality of jQuery and how to manipulate the Document Object Model with it. It was built from a design-template in which I coded all of the JavaScript necessary to construct it.

##Details:
This page was created as a project during the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. I graduated on August 23rd, 2015 and have since updated the page to reflect my current information.

The interactive resume is a more interesting way to present oneself to employers by showing off some web development skills in the process. It uses a very lightweight HTML frame which is manipulated through the use of JavaScript with jQuery in order to append all personal information to it after the DOM has already been constructed. This makes it very easy to update and increase interactivity by displaying information in different ways simply by adjusting the script while leaving the HTML frame alone.

##Lessons learned building this project:
  * How to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript
  * How to utilize jQuery for interacting with the DOM more easily
  * How to build and utilize JSON objects
  * The utility of light-weight reusable HTML frames

###Instructions for Use:
  * Download the full repository and open the index.html file in your browser or alternatively, visit my Github Pages version at: [http://mjroncone.github.io/interactive-resume](http://mjroncone.github.io/interactive-resume "Mike Roncone's Interactive Resume").
  * Once open, feel free to explore the details of my resume. Click on employer links to open up new tabs to their websites, or click on projects links to open those in new tabs.
  * Interact with the map showing places that I have lived or worked. It is a fully functioning Google Maps map.
